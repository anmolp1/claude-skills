# GTM Plan Structure Reference

This document defines the required structure, sections, and content standards for
every 90-Day GTM Plan generated by this skill.

---

## Document Structure

### Cover Page
- Company name (large, primary color)
- "90-Day Go-to-Market Plan" (subtitle)
- "Business Development Playbook" (tertiary)
- Date and confidentiality notice
- One-line outcome target: "Target: X closed deals | $YK–$ZK pipeline | N named accounts"

### Executive Summary (1 page max)
Concise overview covering:
- What this plan achieves in 90 days (specific deal and pipeline targets)
- The two (or more) service lines being sold
- Target market definition (stage, revenue, verticals, geographies)
- Pricing model summary (project-based, not hourly — or as ICP specifies)
- The churn dynamic and why pipeline replenishment is structural

## Phase 1: Foundation & Research (Weeks 1–2)

### Section 1.1: Geography Strategy
**Required table columns:**
| Geography | Why It Matters | Buying Pattern | Avg. Cycle | Priority Verticals |

For each geography, the entry must address:
- Market size and concentration of ICP-fit companies
- How buyers in that geography evaluate and purchase consulting services
- Specific differences in communication style, relationship requirements, procurement
- Expected sales cycle length for door-opener engagements
- Which ICP verticals are most prevalent in that geography

### Section 1.2: Target Account List
**Minimum 50 accounts, target 75–100.** Segmented by geography.

**Required table columns per geography:**
| Company | Vertical | Decision Maker | Persona | Trigger Event | Known Stack |

**Account selection criteria (from ICP):**
- Company must match the ICP's firmographic profile (stage, revenue, headcount)
- Must have at least one technographic match (DW, transformation tool, etc.)
- Must have an identifiable trigger event
- Decision-maker must be mappable to an ICP persona
- Must NOT hit any hard disqualifiers

**Distribution targets (adjust per ICP):**
- US: 30–40 accounts
- Europe: 10–15 accounts
- Middle East: 8–12 accounts
- Australia: 10–15 accounts
- Singapore: 8–12 accounts

### Section 1.3: Foundation Setup Deliverables
List specific week 1–2 actions:
- Contact data enrichment (tools: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo.io, etc.)
- CRM/tracker setup (HubSpot, Notion, or as appropriate)
- Outreach sequence drafting (for Phase 2)
- LinkedIn presence audit for the firm's visible leader
- Case study one-pager creation (one per primary persona)

---

## Phase 2: Outbound Activation (Weeks 3–6)

### Section 2.1: Channel Strategy
**Required table columns:**
| Channel | Approach | Weekly Volume | Expected Response Rate | Target Persona |

**Minimum channels to cover:**
1. LinkedIn Cold Outreach — personalized connection requests + follow-ups
2. Cold Email Sequences — multi-touch with A/B testing
3. Warm Introductions — systematic referral requests from network
4. LinkedIn Content Engagement — substantive comments + original posts
5. Events & Community — meetups, webinars, lightning talks
6. Partnerships — referral relationships with complementary firms

For each channel, the approach must be SPECIFIC:
- ❌ "I'll reach out to people on LinkedIn"
- ✅ "25 personalized connection requests/week referencing a specific pain point,
   followed by a case study one-pager after accept"

### Section 2.2: Messaging by Service Line
**Required table columns:**
| Element | Service Line 1 | Service Line 2 | ... |

**Required rows:**
- Core Pain (the prospect's words, in quotes)
- Value Proposition (how the firm solves it)
- Proof Points (specific metrics from past work)
- Pricing Anchor (door-opener and strategic range)
- Differentiation (why this firm vs. cheaper alternatives)

### Section 2.3: Qualification Gate
Reference the ICP's qualification checklist. State:
- The pass threshold (e.g., ≥4 of 5)
- How discovery is positioned (paid or free, and why)
- The standard qualifying question to prevent scope creep

### Section 2.4: Funnel Math
**Required table columns:**
| Metric | Week 3–4 | Week 5–6 | Cumulative |

**Required rows (minimum):**
- Cold outreach sent (broken down by channel)
- Warm intro requests sent
- Expected replies (with conversion rate shown)
- Expected warm intros converted
- Discovery calls booked (highlighted — this is the key output)
- Proposals sent (with call-to-proposal conversion rate shown)

The math must be internally consistent. If you claim 5% reply rate on 400 touches,
that's 20 replies, not 30.

---

## Phase 3: Pipeline & Closure (Weeks 7–12)

### Section 3.1: Pipeline Targets
**Required table columns:**
| Metric | Conservative | Stretch |

**Required rows:**
- Total discovery calls (cumulative 90 days)
- Proposals sent
- Deals closed (with close rate stated)
- Closed revenue (with deal mix stated — e.g., "2 door-openers + 1 strategic")
- Active pipeline value (proposals pending + qualified opportunities)
- Geography-specific pipeline notes (especially ME longer-cycle deals)

### Section 3.2: Weekly Activity Plan
**Required table columns:**
| Week | Key Activities | Pipeline Actions | Calls Target | Proposals |

Cover weeks 7–8, 9–10, and 11–12 as distinct rows.

### Section 3.3: Upsell & Cross-Sell Framework
**Required table columns:**
| Entry Engagement | Natural Upsell (Same Persona) | Cross-Sell (Adjacent Persona) | Timing |

Map every door-opener service to its natural expansion path. State:
- What the upsell is and its price range
- Which new persona gets brought in for cross-sell
- When the expansion conversation happens (e.g., "Week 3 of audit")

---

## Pricing & Positioning Section

Must include a comparison table:
| Dimension | [This Firm] | Cheaper Alternative |

Cover: what you're buying, risk profile, speed to value, expansion potential.

Must explicitly address the firm's pricing model and why it's structured that way.

---

## Pipeline Replenishment Section

Must include a table of 3 mechanisms:
| Mechanism | How It Works | Target Impact |

Standard mechanisms:
1. Built-in expansion paths (week 3 conversation)
2. Always-on outbound engine (reduced but never zero during delivery)
3. Testimonial-driven inbound growth

Must include geography-specific churn notes.

## Self-Assessment Scoring Rubric

| Criteria | What "Good" Looks Like | How This Plan Delivers | Score |

Five criteria:
1. Specificity
2. Realistic Math
3. Pricing & Positioning
4. Geography Nuance
5. Churn & Replenishment
