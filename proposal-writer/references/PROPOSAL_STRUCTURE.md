# Proposal Structure Reference

Detailed specifications for each proposal section.

## 1. Executive Summary

**Length:** 3–5 sentences.
**Tone:** Confident, specific, outcome-focused.

**Structure:**
1. State the prospect's problem (in their words if possible)
2. State the proposed approach (1 sentence)
3. State the expected outcome and timeline
4. Optional: anchor to business value ("this will save/generate $X")

**Example:**
> Acme Corp's revenue data is spread across HubSpot, Snowflake, and three spreadsheets,
> making board reporting a 2-day manual process every month. We propose a 6-week Revenue
> Data Platform engagement to unify these sources into a single, automated reporting layer.
> By week 8, your board deck will generate in minutes, not days — freeing your RevOps team
> to focus on pipeline, not spreadsheets.

**Anti-pattern:** Starting with "Thank you for the opportunity to present this proposal."
The prospect knows it's a proposal. Get to the point.

## 2. Understanding

**Length:** 1–2 paragraphs or 3–5 bullet points.
**Purpose:** Prove you listened. Reference specific things from the brief, call, or notes.

**What to include:**
- Their current situation (tools, team size, stage)
- The specific pain they described
- What's at stake if they don't act
- Any constraints they mentioned (budget, timeline, team bandwidth)

**Anti-pattern:** Restating generic industry problems. If it could apply to any company,
it's too vague.

## 3. Scope of Work

**Format:** Numbered workstreams, each with:
- Workstream name (descriptive, not generic)
- 2–4 named deliverables per workstream
- Owner (consultant team vs. client team) for each deliverable
- What's explicitly excluded (prevents scope creep)

**Example workstream:**
> **Workstream 1: Revenue Data Audit**
> - Deliverable 1.1: Data source inventory (all CRM, analytics, and finance tools mapped)
> - Deliverable 1.2: Data quality assessment report (completeness, freshness, accuracy scores)
> - Deliverable 1.3: Gap analysis document (what's missing for board-ready reporting)
> - Owner: Consultant team (client provides tool access)
>
> **Not included:** Migrating data between tools, building custom ETL pipelines, or
> replacing existing BI dashboards.

## 4. Approach & Methodology

**Format:** Phase breakdown (2–4 phases) with:
- Phase name and duration
- Key activities (3–5 per phase)
- Phase exit criteria (what must be true before moving to the next phase)

**Keep it practical.** Methodology descriptions should tell the prospect what will
actually happen week-by-week, not describe an abstract framework. Avoid jargon
like "leveraging our proprietary methodology" — describe the work.

## 5. Timeline & Milestones

**Format:** Table or visual timeline.

| Week | Phase | Milestone | Checkpoint |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1–2 | Discovery | Data audit complete | Review meeting |
| 3–4 | Build | Pipeline architecture deployed | Demo walkthrough |
| 5–6 | Validate | Board report template live | Stakeholder sign-off |

**Rules:**
- Always include a kickoff milestone (Week 1, Day 1)
- Include at least one mid-engagement checkpoint
- End with a handoff / knowledge transfer milestone
- If timeline depends on client actions, state that explicitly

## 6. Team

**Format:** Role + 1–2 sentence relevant experience. Not full bios.

**Example:**
> **Engagement Lead** — 8+ years building revenue data platforms for Series A–C SaaS
> companies. Led similar engagements at [comparable company type].
>
> **Data Engineer** — Specialist in dbt, Snowflake, and CRM integrations. Previously
> built the analytics stack for a $50M ARR fintech.

**Rules:**
- 2–4 team members max (for a typical consulting engagement)
- Focus on relevant experience, not career history
- If using subcontractors, be transparent about it
- Include the client-side roles you'll need (e.g., "we'll need 2 hours/week from your data team lead")

## 7. Investment

**Format:** Pricing table with line items.

| Phase | Scope | Investment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Phase 1: Discovery | Data audit + gap analysis | $15,000 |
| Phase 2: Build | Pipeline + reporting layer | $45,000 |
| Phase 3: Enablement | Training + documentation | $10,000 |
| **Total** | | **$70,000** |

**Rules:**
- Always show a total
- Break down by phase or workstream, not by person or hour
- If offering payment terms, state them here (e.g., "50% on kickoff, 50% on delivery")
- Optional: include a value anchor ("based on 20 hours/month saved at your team's cost, ROI payback is ~3 months")
- If there are optional add-ons, list them separately below the main table

**Anti-pattern:** Showing a daily rate or hourly rate. Price the outcome.

## 8. Terms & Next Steps

**Include:**
- Proposal validity period (typically 30 days)
- Payment terms (e.g., net-30, milestone-based)
- How to accept (sign and return, email confirmation, etc.)
- Change request process (how scope changes are handled)
- Cancellation terms (if applicable)

**Keep it simple.** This is not a legal contract — it's a proposal. Heavy legal
language kills momentum. For significant engagements, note that a formal MSA or
SOW will follow upon acceptance.

**End with a clear CTA:**
> To proceed, reply to this email confirming acceptance or schedule a call to
> discuss any questions. This proposal is valid through [date].
