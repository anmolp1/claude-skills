# Revenue Projection Structure Reference

This document defines the required structure and methodology for every Y1–Y3
revenue projection generated by this skill.

---

## Core Methodology: Bottom-Up Only

Every revenue dollar must trace to:
```
Revenue = Net New Deals × ACV + Expansion Deals × Expansion ACV - Churn
```

Never use top-down approaches (TAM → SAM → SOM → capture rate). This is a
consulting firm, not a VC pitch.

## Document Structure

### Cover Page
- Company name
- "Revenue Projection: Year 1 – Year 3"
- "Based on the 90-Day GTM Plan"
- Date and confidentiality notice

### Key Assumptions & Model Inputs
**Required table columns:**
| Assumption | Conservative | Base | Aggressive |

**Required rows:**
1. Door-opener ACV (average)
2. Strategic engagement ACV (average)
3. Door-opener → strategic expansion rate
4. Quarterly net new deals closed (Y1 average)
5. Client quarterly churn rate
6. Geography-specific ACV premiums (e.g., Middle East)
7. Inbound share of pipeline (by Y1 end)
8. Y2 deal volume growth (vs Y1)
9. Y3 deal volume growth (vs Y2)
10. Delivery capacity constraint (max concurrent projects)

**Important note to include:**
Consulting firms are not SaaS companies. "ARR" means annualized run-rate of booked
project revenue. Revenue recognition is lumpy. State this clearly.

## Year 1: Detailed Quarterly Breakdown

### Y1 Quarterly Table
**Required columns:**
| Metric | Q1 (Ramp) | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |

**Required rows:**
1. New door-openers closed
2. Door-opener revenue
3. Expansions triggered (with conversion rate and lag shown)
4. Expansion revenue
5. Geography-specific deals (especially ME, which closes later)
6. Quarterly revenue total (highlighted)
7. Active concurrent projects
8. Discovery calls per month

### Y1 Summary Box
Three-column highlight:
| Y1 Conservative | Y1 Base | Y1 Aggressive |
With revenue range and deal count for each.

### Y1 Revenue Math Walkthrough
Narrative explanation of the base case math:
- New door-opener revenue = count × ACV
- Expansion revenue = expansion count × expansion ACV × recognition %
- Geography premium = ME deals × multiplier
- Total before adjustment
- Churn and timing adjustment
- Final range with midpoint

State that the wide range reflects timing uncertainty (a single large deal
crossing a year-end boundary swings the number by $150K–$200K).

## Year 2: Growth Analysis

### Y2 Growth Drivers Table
**Required columns:**
| Driver | What Changes | Revenue Impact |

**Required drivers to cover:**
1. Higher deal velocity (mature outbound + partner referrals)
2. Inbound flywheel (content + testimonials → organic demand)
3. Expansion maturity (higher conversion rate, larger strategic ACVs)
4. Geography maturation (especially Middle East reference clients)
5. Delivery team expansion (first hires, capacity increase)

### Y2 Summary Box
Same format as Y1.

### Y2 Revenue Math
Same narrative walkthrough as Y1, showing ~2x growth logic.

---

## Year 3: Scaling Analysis

### Y3 Growth Drivers Table
Same structure as Y2, covering:
1. Brand gravity (recognized name, 40–50% inbound)
2. ACV growth (premium pricing from proven track record)
3. Service line expansion (new offerings, productization)
4. Team scaling (4–6 consultants, operational leverage)
5. Geographic deepening (anchor clients in all geos)

### Y3 Summary Box
Same format.

## Three-Year Summary

### Summary Table
**Required columns:**
| Year | Conservative | Base | Aggressive | Key Milestone |

**Required rows:**
- Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, 3-Year Cumulative

### Revenue by Geography Table
Show Y3 run-rate distribution:
| | US | Europe | Middle East | Australia | Singapore |
With percentage and dollar amount for each.

## Risks, Sensitivities & Capacity Constraints

### Risk Table
**Required columns:**
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Probability |

**Required risks to cover (minimum):**
1. Delivery bottleneck (founder as single point) — HIGH probability
2. Expansion rate underperformance — MEDIUM
3. Middle East cycle delays — MEDIUM-HIGH
4. Macro downturn reducing SaaS spending — LOW-MEDIUM
5. Churn exceeding 50% quarterly — MEDIUM
6. Inbound not materializing by Y2 — LOW

Use color coding: red fill for high-probability risks, no fill for low.

### Sensitivity Analysis Section
Identify the single biggest variable (usually expansion rate) and quantify:
"Each 1% improvement in [variable] ≈ $XK additional annual revenue"

## Closing Summary

Centered, highlighted box with:
- 3-year base case cumulative revenue
- Y1 / Y2 / Y3 midpoints
- One-line strategic insight (e.g., "The constraint is delivery capacity, not demand")

## Scenario Design Rules

### Conservative Scenario
- Solo delivery, no hires
- Pessimistic conversion rates (bottom of benchmark range)
- No inbound contribution
- High churn (50%+)
- ME deals slip to following year
- Only door-openers close, few expansions

### Base Scenario
- 1–2 hires by end of Y1
- Middle-of-range conversion rates
- Growing inbound (20–30% by Y1 end)
- Standard churn (35–45%)
- ME deals close but lag 1 quarter
- 50% expansion rate

### Aggressive Scenario
- 3+ hires, subcontractors available
- Optimistic conversion rates
- Strong inbound (30–40% by Y1 end)
- Low churn (25–30%)
- ME deals close on schedule
- 60%+ expansion rate
- Must note: "requires hiring and operational investment"

The gap between conservative and aggressive should be 2–3x, not 1.2x.
If it's less than 2x, the scenarios aren't differentiated enough.
