## Proven Conversion Benchmarks (B2B Consulting Outbound)

These benchmarks are calibrated for boutique consulting firms selling project-based
engagements to mid-market B2B companies. Adjust ranges based on your pricing tier,
industry, and sales motion.

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic | Source |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|--------|
| LinkedIn connection accept rate | 6% | 10% | 15% | |
| LinkedIn reply rate (after accept) | 3% | 5% | 8% | |
| Cold email reply rate | 2% | 4% | 6% | |
| Warm intro → discovery call | 25% | 35% | 45% | |
| Discovery call → proposal | 40% | 50% | 65% | |
| Proposal → close (door-opener) | 25% | 33% | 40% | |
| Proposal → close (strategic) | 20% | 28% | 35% | |
| Door-opener → expansion | 30% | 50% | 65% | |
| Content-driven inbound (Y1 end) | 10% | 20% | 35% | |
| Quarterly client churn rate | 50% | 40% | 25% | |

## Geography Heuristics

### Account Distribution Ratios (Default)
When the ICP specifies multiple geographies without explicit weighting:
- **US**: 35–40% of target accounts (largest market, highest competition)
- **Europe**: 15–20% (UK as primary entry, DACH/Nordics as secondary)
- **Middle East**: 10–15% (fewer accounts, higher ACV, longer cycles)
- **Australia**: 10–15% (mature market)
- **Singapore/APAC**: 10–15% (hub for regional companies)

Adjust if the ICP explicitly emphasizes or de-emphasizes a geography.

### Cycle Length Multipliers
When the ICP doesn't specify cycle lengths, use these defaults:
- **US**: 1.0x base (3–6 weeks for door-openers)
- **Australia**: 0.8x (slightly faster, more direct)
- **Singapore**: 1.0x (comparable to US)
- **Europe (UK)**: 1.2x (slightly more relationship-driven)
- **Europe (DACH/Nordics)**: 1.5x (methodical, detailed scoping)
- **Middle East**: 2.5x (relationship-gated, requires trust-building)

### ACV Multipliers by Geography
Relative to the ICP's stated base pricing:
- **US**: 1.0x (base)
- **Europe**: 1.0–1.1x (slightly higher for DACH, comparable for UK)
- **Middle East**: 1.3–1.8x (budget-rich, premium for trust)
- **Australia**: 0.9–1.0x (pragmatic buyers, slight discount pressure)
- **Singapore**: 0.9–1.0x (similar to Australia)

## Revenue Modeling Patterns

### Y1 Revenue Shape
Consulting firm Y1 revenue is ALWAYS back-loaded:
- **Q1**: 5–10% of annual revenue (ramp period, mostly door-openers)
- **Q2**: 20–25% (first expansions trigger, some ME deals land)
- **Q3**: 30–35% (engine producing, expansions compounding)
- **Q4**: 30–40% (full capacity, pipeline mature)

Never model flat quarterly revenue in Y1. It's unrealistic.

### Growth Rate Guardrails
- **Y1 → Y2**: 60–100% growth is realistic for a consulting firm scaling from
  founder-led to small team. Below 40% suggests the GTM motion isn't working.
  Above 120% requires aggressive hiring.
- **Y2 → Y3**: 40–60% growth. The firm is now known, inbound is contributing,
  but growth rate decelerates. Below 25% suggests market saturation or delivery
  constraints. Above 80% requires 5+ hires and operational infrastructure.
- **Y3+**: 20–40% is sustainable. Beyond this requires productization or
  significant team scaling.

### The Expansion Rate Rule of Thumb
The door-opener → strategic expansion rate is the single biggest variable in
consulting revenue models. A useful sensitivity check:
- Each 1% improvement in expansion rate can yield significant additional annual revenue
- This makes the expansion conversation the highest-leverage activity in the business

### Delivery Capacity Constraints
Revenue models MUST account for delivery capacity:
- **Solo founder**: 3–4 concurrent projects max
- **Founder + 1 senior hire**: 5–6 concurrent
- **Team of 4–5**: 8–10 concurrent
- **Team of 6+**: 10–15 concurrent

If the revenue model projects more than capacity allows, flag it and note that
hiring must happen.

## Target Account Selection Lessons

### What Makes a Good Target Account
1. **Real company** — must be verifiable, not hypothetical
2. **Stage match** — within the ICP's revenue/funding range
3. **Stack signal** — publicly known or inferable use of the ICP's preferred tools
4. **Active trigger** — recent event that creates urgency (funding, new hire, tool adoption)
5. **Accessible decision-maker** — the relevant persona exists and is findable on LinkedIn
6. **No disqualifiers** — doesn't hit any of the ICP's hard or soft disqualifiers

### Common Account Selection Mistakes
- Naming companies that are too well-known/large (they have internal teams for this)
- Picking companies in the ICP's "avoid" verticals
- Selecting pre-revenue startups when the ICP requires a revenue floor
- Not checking if the company has recently been acquired (changes decision-making)
- Naming the same company twice (parent + subsidiary)

### Stack Inference Rules
When exact tech stack isn't publicly known, infer from signals:
- Job postings mentioning relevant tools → likely ICP-fit stack
- Relevant engineering roles → adoption signal
- Cloud partner badges → cloud environment confirmation
- Tool pairings (e.g., Looker → likely BigQuery)

## Messaging Patterns That Work

### Emotional → Logical Sequence
1. **Open emotional**: "We saw your post about X and it resonated"
2. **Bridge with specificity**: "We recently audited a similar setup for [client]"
3. **Close logical**: "Here's the specific audit scope and what we'll deliver in N weeks"

## Document Generation Patterns

### Table Color Coding
Use color to encode meaning consistently:
- **Blue (#EBF5FB)**: Informational, neutral emphasis
- **Green (#E8F8F5)**: Positive outcomes, targets met, revenue
- **Yellow (#FEF9E7)**: Caution, conservative scenario, moderate risk
- **Red (#FDEDEC)**: Risk, high probability issues, negative scenarios
- **Gray (#F5F5F5)**: Alternating rows for readability

### Scenario Differentiation
The three scenarios must represent genuinely different strategic paths, not just ±10%:
- **Conservative**: Solo delivery, cautious assumptions, no inbound, high churn
- **Base**: Small team, proven conversion rates, growing inbound, standard churn
- **Aggressive**: Full team, optimistic conversion, strong inbound, low churn + requires
  hiring and subcontractors
